# As of 31st October 2018, PyOS is no longer in development.
## A true Python multitool that will be left for dead thanks to awful, awful design and over 2000 lines to ammend.

My largest project to date, PyOS was designed to be an all in one powerhouse of many different Python features, ranging from basic math functions to voice input to high security UAC and password encryption. I'm sure it would be so much more useful if the code was closed-source, but hey, the idea was there. Maybe one day I'll come back to this and convert it so it can run on >Python 3.4, but for now, it's time to put PyOS to sleep. 

## PyOS
*Welcome to PyOS!*
The most inappropriately named program of all time! 
This is a multi function Python-based CLI that can do a multitude of things. Lets go over some of the main features.
## Encryption // No passwords saved
Using Pycryptodomex, PyOS stores passwords and encrypted files securely. Your actual password is not saved anywhere, which ensures security for your password and your encrypted files.
## Multi User System // Secuirty features
PyOS offers multiple user accouts with seperated folders for personal files. PyOS also provides an Admin account, which can access or disable user accounts. PyOS offers heightened security, and keeps the admin updated on user activities using logs.
## Auto Updater // Backup installer
PyOS is able to update and reinstall itself, and will notify the user when an update is available. PyOS also creates a backup of the current version every time an update is performed, and you can choose to reinstall this backup at any time.
## No Modules? No Problem! // Support for all users
PyOS relies on Pycryptodomex for encryption, and PyAudio and SpeechRecognition for voice input. However, if you don't have these features, PyOS will still work! Just with limited features.
## Powerful Program Customization // Change how the program works for you
PyOS allows administrators to change how the program works - auto logins, pause on startup to read boot messages, disable window resizing, allow all users to be administrators, however you want the program to run, PyOS can support it. 
## Pointless Tools For Fun! // In case you're downloading this for no real reason
PyOS also offers application support, and can download python apps stored in PyOS/pyos-apps on this github page. PyOS also comes with Voice Dictation, and allows voice input to be saved to a text file (Requires SpeechRecognition and Pyaudio)
## The most comprehensive Python tool of all time!
I'm probably overselling now, but PyOS can do a lot more than what is advertised here. Give it a download and see what PyOS can do for you!
